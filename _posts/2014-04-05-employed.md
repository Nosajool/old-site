I was fortunate enough to end up with a job after the first round of interviews in early March. It definitely took away some stress and allowed me to really focus on school without having to worry about interviews. The best part was that out of the 5 places I got interviews with, I ended up getting matched with the company I wanted. But boy did I get lucky. Before explaining what my scenario was, here’s a snippet from the [Centre for Career Action website](https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/get-hired/ranking-matching) regarding how a potential co-op student and employer get matched after an interview:

For each position, there are about 8-15 students interviewed and the number of students that get ranked is up to the company. However, if I were to guess, I would say the employer ranks their top 5 students. Out of the 5 interviews that I had, I got ranked for 2 of them but had no offers. This means that for me to get either job, the students who got the offers would have to accept a different offer or rank the offer a high number so that the system matches them with a “ranked” that they ranked with a high priority. As I am a first year student with no programming work experience, I was happy with either job and so to maximize my chances of being employed, I ranked both of them a “1″. Both jobs were pretty awesome but there was definitely one that I was leaning more towards and was delighted when all of the possible variables fell perfectly into place.

This summer, I will be working at Kik Interactive as a part of the Release and QA Engineering team! Kik is a company that currently has one product, Kik Messenger, a smartphone messaging application with over 120 million users. I’ve been a user of Kik Messenger for over 3 years and have watched the company grow from a start up in the Velocity Garage to where it is today. It’s probably still considered a start up as they have about 30 full time employees and 10-15 co-op students. Nevertheless, this is exactly the type of environment that I want to experience for my first co-op. A small team behind a huge product with the incessant drive and motivation to upgrade and take their app to the next level.

There’s a huge list of technical, physical and social goals that I want to achieve during my co-op term and I’m eager to start hacking away at it as soon as the school term ends. With my summer bucket list set and my first tech job awaiting me, I just have one last hurdle to overcome. Bring it on finals.
