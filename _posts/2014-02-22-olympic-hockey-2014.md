Reading Week couldn’t have come at a better time. Not only did I get the chance to catch up on my classes *cough* electro-mag, I also got to watch the 2014 Olympics and some great hockey! During the year, I didn’t have the time to watch NHL games and was limited to highlights but this week, I finally saw one from start to finish. Being still butt hurt that Team USA cut Bobby Ryan, I looked forward to the ass-whopping that Canada would hand them. You wouldn’t be able to tell from the 1-0 score, but Canada completely dominated the play. Aside from a couple first period scares, the team played a solid defensive game and stopped Kessel and Kane from creating any offence.

Although Canada was for the most part playing a, “Get a shot and then sub off” style of game, there were 3 players who stood out for me:
- Matt Duchene: This guy skates like a beast. Accelerates so quickly to pounce on loose pucks.
- Patrice Bergeron: Excellent stick checks caused so many turnovers.
- Drew Doughty: Makes the clean first pass through the neutral zone and isn’t afraid of skating with the puck, deking around the first check and then wiring a shot at the net. (I’m still in awe at the along the ice wrister against Tukka Rask in the 2-1 overtime win)

All in all, Canada was a much larger and faster team than Team USA. They outplayed them in almost every way imaginable and definitely deserved the win. Even though it was just the semi-finals, the game was played with the intensity of a gold medal game. Obviously, there isn’t the same rivalry with Sweeden as there is with the US, but I’m hoping tomorrow morning at 7:00 a.m., we’ll have the same sort of game but with more goals! Hoping for Karlsson to score 9 in the first period and then Canada comes back to win it 10-9 in a 20 round shootout.
Other highlights of my first reading week include a strange game of hockey on the outdoor rink (because 2 of my friends used shovels instead of sticks) and enjoying an Ottawa Shawarma.
