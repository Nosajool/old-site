It's pretty depressing when I look at the odds of making the playoffs of my favourite teams:

- Washington Capitals – 26.5%
- Vancouver Canucks – 2%
- Ottawa Senators – 1.9%

## Vancouver Canucks
Um…what just happened? The Canucks were doing great until the end of January when they went on their atrocious losing streak and fell into a hole too deep to climb out of. Did Torteralla’s shenanigans during the Calgary game destroy the locker room atmosphere? Does Daniel lose all of his scoring abilities when Henrik is injured? Were Mike Santorelli and an under performing Alex Burrows the backbones of this team? There are so many questions to be asked about the Canucks. The biggest one for me is how Luongo and Schneider got replaced by Lack and Markstrom within a year…I don’t know what to say.

## Washington Capitals
I just want Grabovski to come back from injury so that Oates’s lineup looks slightly less dumb. Why is Jay Beagle of all people Ovechkin’s centre? I’m glad my new favourite Capital, Evgeny Kuznetsov got promoted to the second line with Backstrom and Brouwer but feel bad for Wilson, who definitely deserves at least third line minutes. Darn, I miss the good old days of the free flowing offensive style that Boudreau allowed the team to portray. Ovechkin, Backstrom, Semin, Fleischmann, Laich, Green and Morisson were able to carry the team with Theodore and Varlamov holding the fort. Now the Caps just dump the puck in and wait for power plays. Yeah… I really hope that their recent playoff push isn’t just giving me false hope since they’ve been frustrating all season.

## Ottawa Senators
The most disappointing stat to look at is the point total of my hometown team. After acquiring Ryan and MacArthur, I definitely believed that the #PeskySens would be able to at least repeat last year’s surprising success. I was also shocked when the trade deadline acquisition, Ales Hemsky’s instant synergy with Spezza wasn’t enough to get the sens the wins they needed. Currently sitting 8 points out of a wild card spot with 9 games remaining and losing Ryan for the season, it’s highly unlikely they make the playoffs this year. It’s only natural to think of the future. OH WAIT…we don’t have a first round pick this year. Ok, regardless, Ottawa’s lineup lookspretty ideal on paper:
Spezza, Ryan, Hemsky, Michalek, Turris and MacArthur form an explosive pack of talent for the first two lines, Smith, Neil and Greening are your textbook third line grinders, and Zibanejad, Condra and Stone/Hoffman/Da Costa/Pageau etc… should all be good enough to fend off other team’s fourth lines. I admit that the Sens’s weak point has been their defensive pairings but they are all pretty young and have the potential to be solid players: Methot, Karlsson, Cowen, Gryba, Wiercioch and Ceci. I don’t understand why we signed Philoops for 2 more years at 2.5 million as a soon to be 7th defense man. In goal, Anderson was an “Elite” goalie last year with net minder of the future, Robin Lehner backing him up. I’m just gonna call this season a fluke, and bring the same expectations I had in September 2013 to September 2014.
 
Sigh..It’s tough being a caps/nucks/sens fan. At least my teams’ have been struggling all season long and have been gradually disappointing me while heartbroken leafs fans are having their dreams crushed in their recent collapse. 8)
