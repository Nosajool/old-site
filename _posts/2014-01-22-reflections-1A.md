At Waterloo, after week 5 of classes, first year engineering students get to enjoy a nice thanksgiving long weekend and are rewarded with a week off from school. Unfortunately, it is to take their midterm examinations. We get one exam per day from Tuesday to Saturday of that 6th week and return to school on the Monday of week 7. It is nicknamed “Hell Week” as it a week of constantly studying, writing your exam and then studying for the one that is tomorrow. Bizarrely, I found “Hell Week” to be the most relaxing week of the term. For once, you don’t have to worry about the weekly assignments for each course, the lab reports and the computer delivered tutorials and can just focus on solving practice problems in preparation for the exams. It was a strange feeling as I felt like I had so much time not having to go to classes for that one week. Nevertheless, midterm exams still important as they are generally worth 10-30% of your final grade. Thus, even though I had tons of free time to chill with friends, I still devoted a good chunk of that week to studying. Keep in mind that midterm results give you a good indication of what areas you are weak in and what you need to focus on for the final stretch.

Finals on the other hand, are a bit more stressful. These tend to be worth 50-80% of the final mark and for the most part, you must pass the final in order to pass the course. There is a theory that if a professor gives you an easy midterm, he’ll give you a hard final. And vice versa. I don’t believe that this applies to all courses but I experienced it for a couple of classes in 1A. Finals are spread out over 3 weeks in December after the completion of the 10th week of class. My exams were spaced evenly with a 1 day break between each one. Once again, I experienced that weird sense of free time that I had felt during midterms. Without classes, and assignments, I found that there was definitely enough time to review all of the material provided you hadn’t fallen behind in the lectures. (I’ll admit, I got lost near the end of the two ECE courses)
Midterms are 1 hour and a half long while finals are 2 and a half hours.

Let’s examine each of the 10 exams that I took this past year in 1A!

## MATH 119 Calculus 1 for Engineering
![Calculus]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/posts/exams-1a/calc.png)
 
### Midterm:
Out of the five classes with exams, I studied the least for this midterm. All of the material for the first 5 weeks had been review of functions and we ended with limits. (And if I recall correctly, we might have covered derivatives by this point) Anyways, most of my class found this to be a very easy midterm and we had a class average of +80%.  I was pretty disappointed in myself as I knew how to solve almost all of the answers but made really dumb mistakes which cost me marks that could have been avoided with more practice.

**Verdict/Advice:** Review your high school calculus notes and you’ll be fine.

### Final:
The midterm served as a good wakeup call for me so in addition to working through the weekly assignment problems, I forced myself to practice additional problems from the textbook. The second half of the term consisted primarily of integration of single variables and it was very easy to find questions to solve from online resources. Prior to finals, I attended an Engineering Society workshop which was an event for their first year mentorship program. Only one other first year attended and there were three upper year students who I got a chance to talk to. I was extremely grateful that they gave me a heads up about this calculus exam as they were completely right about the difficulty. Easy midterm, insane final. A lot of students struggled with it as it was their first time learning how to integrate a function and we were given quite challenging ones on the final. Each question was worth at least 6 or 7 marks so if you didn’t know how to solve one, you lost a lot off of your final grade. Luckily, I took the upper year’s advice and systematically went through the textbook and course notes, learning and identifying patterns so that on the exam, I could quickly recognize and determine how I would solve the problems. Hard work paid off and I killed this final.

**Verdict/Advice:**  If you didn’t take AP calculus, you’ll quickly learn that, “I don’t study for math courses” isn’t going to work anymore.

## MATH 115 Linear Algebra for Engineering
![Linear Algebra]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/posts/exams-1a/linalg.png)

### Midterm:
Very straight forward. The assignments are much harder than the midterm questions so if you did well on the assignments, then the midterm will be easy. Otherwise, I suggest reading the text book as it does a fantastic job and conveying concepts. In this course, I found that in terms of difficulty, assignments>final>quizzes>midterm.

**Verdict/Advice:**  The midterm contains some material from your vectors class in high school but all new material is explained well by the textbook.
### Final:
Once again, there weren’t any surprises on the final. The questions were all variations of the assignments and quizzes minus the assignment questions that take up a whole page of calculations. We covered a lot of material in this course so it was understandable that the questions were not too specific.

**Verdict/Advice:**  When preparing for the final, redo your assignments and quizzes as the final is just a bunch of variations of these types of questions.

## ECE 140 Linear Circuits
![Circuits]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/posts/exams-1a/circuits.png)

### Midterm:
If you can do the previous year’s midterms, then you are pretty much set for this one. There are only so many tricks that the professor can throw at you with such few circuit elements and if you’ve been following along with his/her examples in class, you shouldn’t have a problem with this one. I believe that our midterm was 4 circuits where in each circuit, we had to find either the voltage, current, resistance or power.

**Verdict/Advice:** Most likely, if you don’t do well on this midterm, it is because you got stuck and spent too much time being unable to find your mistake. Don’t erase anything. State that you know that your answer is impossible because of conditions x and y but continue to solve the problem as if your answer could still be correct. Professors mark you on your process and if you make a stupid calculation mistake, it will only cost you 1 mark out of 10 if the rest of your solution is correct.

### Final:
This course ramped up so fast after the midterm. Once complex numbers were involved, I was completely lost as it was very difficult to process so much new material in such a little amount of time. This is the course where I kicked myself in the butt for not keeping up with the optional assignments as they would have helped my understanding so much. I did them eventually while studying just prior to my final but by then it was too late and I didn’t have enough time and practice to absorb and use the techniques to perfection on the final. Yes, my circuits mark dropped from a very high midterm mark but I only have myself to blame.

**Verdict/Advice:**  Do the optional assignments. Just do them.

## ECE 105: Physics 1 of Electrical Engineering
![Physics]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/posts/exams-1a/physics.jpg)

### Midterm:
“You ain’t an engineer until you’ve failed the physics midterm!” Enough said. You might have thought you were good at physics in high school but you are about to get destroyed. The concepts are the same as in high school up until the midterm but the questions are on a whole different level.  There are 3 reasons why this test is difficult.
A.	The questions are hard.
B.	The midterm is too long.
C.	You are meant to do poorly.
If you manage to do well on this midterm, I commend you. However for many, this exam is the wakeup call as they’ve never failed a test before. And this is a good thing as the question difficulty doesn’t get any easier but you get introduced to new topics such as rotation, rolling and simple harmonic motion which were not covered in high school.

**Verdict/Advice:**  Study your hardest but don’t dwell on this experience as you are not alone. Continue doing the assignments, attending the lectures, extra help sessions and practice problems on your own in order to prepare for the final.
### Final:
The questions on the final are of equal difficulty to the questions on the midterm but the key change is that you have an extra hour to solve the questions. Believe me, the extra time helps a lot. Also, by now, the midterm would have already broken you so you’d have studied a lot harder for the final and would have come in with a different mindset. Even though many people fail the midterm, it is rare for students to fail the final. It’s just one of those things. Their scare tactic works.

**Verdict/Advice:** You’ll learn from the midterm that you have to change your study habits and will work hard to earn your physics final grade.

## CS 137: Programming Principles
![CS]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/posts/exams-1a/cs.png) 

### Midterm:
I believe now, in order to get into the Software Engineering Program at the University of Waterloo, you need prior programming experience. I agree with this as this course is very tough if you have never programmed before. This was the only class that had a bi-modal distribution in terms of marks as the class was essentially divided into people that knew how to program in high school and people who didn’t. We went through the basics very quickly for a new programmer as it is assumed that you know how to use variables, loops and arrays. The most shocking thing for many students was that tests in computer science are all written by hand. I advise you all to take your notes in pen or pencil and then if you’d like to prove to yourself that the code works, type it up when you get home. You don’t get syntax highlighting on exams so make sure to literally indent your written lines of code and close all of your if/loop statements.

**Verdict/Advice:** If you have written any programming contests such as the DWITE or the CCC and got at least one question correct, this midterm will be a piece of cake. Most of the questions are, “Write a function that takes in an input and then do something with those numbers/characters”. This is a very good practice site for these sorts of questions.

### Final:
The course ramps up once again after midterm and you learn about big O notation along with basic sorting and searching algorithms. You’ll also learn about the joys of C strings and pointers which Java programmers don’t usually experience until this course. The final has the same types of questions as the midterm. However, the main difference isn’t the difficulty, it is the length of the exam. Our final was 26 questions while the midterm had 10. Implementing 26 independent functions was pretty exhausting and it was hard to keep focused for the entire duration. About an hour in, I remember thinking to myself, “Ugh…12 more pages”.

**Verdict/Advice:** Get a good night’s sleep, and persevere through this this exam. Even if you don’t have time to finish every question, write pseudo code and you might get part marks. The questions aren’t that tough if you could do the assignments, there are just a lot of them.
